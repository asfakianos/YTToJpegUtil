# Python Download Utility  
Youtube video downloader that downloads videos (given a link) and outputs each frame to a directory. Run with `python youtube_utility.py <URL>`. Output directory is inferred from the video title, but can be specified as a secondary argument (after `<URL>`). Each frame is saved in .jpg format before the video is deleted.
